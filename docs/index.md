# This is a temproary placeholder for `jj` "released" version documentation

This will be replaced with docs for `jj v0.9.0` when that is released. At that
point, this version will be deleted.

For now, this is an unpolished version of docs for `jj v.0.8.0` release, but
I gave up on cleaning it up to a point where we could show it to the users.
