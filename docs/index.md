# This is a temproary placeholder for the "released" version of `jj` documentation

If you see this, you probably want to immediately **switch to
the prerelease version using the dropdown above**.

This will be deleted and replaced with docs for `jj v0.9.0` when that is released. 

For now, this is an unpolished version of docs for `jj v.0.8.0` release. It exists so that you can test out the redirects
and the version switcher. I gave up on cleaning it up to a point where we could show it to the users.
